Mission "Build the Castle"

    The Core Rule: "Get the King to his panic room."

    The Concept (Castling): The center of the board is a dangerous highway with arrows flying everywhere. Castling puts the King in a safe bunker behind a wall of pawns. Do it as fast as you can!

    The Lab (Exercise):

        Castle Rush: Play a game where the only goal is to castle. Count how many moves it takes. Try to beat your record (aim for castling by move 7!).

    Progress Check: What are the two rules that stop you from castling? (Answer: If you moved the King already, or if you are in Check).
