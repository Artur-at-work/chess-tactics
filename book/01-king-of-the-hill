Part 1: The Opening (Building Your Fortress)

Goal: General rules to start the game to gain strategic advantage for later stage. Each rule per session, not necessarily week.

Mission "King of the Hill"

    The Core Rule: "Control the center, control the game."

    The Concept: The four squares in the very middle of the board (e4, d4, e5, d5) are the top of the hill. If your pieces are there, they can see everything!

    The Lab (Exercise):

        The Pawn Race: Put only Pawns on the board. The first person to get a Pawn to the center squares and keep it there safely for 2 moves wins a point.

    Progress Check: Point to the four center squares. Why do we want our pieces to live there?
