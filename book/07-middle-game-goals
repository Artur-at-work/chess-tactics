🎯 Goal #1: The "Gang Up" (Overloading)

This is the most important strategy for kids. Instead of just trading (1 vs 1), teach her to attack a piece with more pieces than the opponent has defending it.

    The Concept: If the opponent has a Pawn defended by one Knight, she needs to attack it with two pieces (maybe a Knight and a Bishop).

    The Metaphor: "Who has more friends?"

    The Rule: "Count the attackers. Count the defenders. If you have more, EAT IT!"

    The Lab: Put a black Pawn on e5 protected by a black Knight. Have her set up a white Knight and Queen to attack it. Show her that because 2>1, she wins the pawn.

👑 Goal #2: King Hunting (Attacking the King)

If the opponent’s King looks unsafe (e.g., they pushed the pawns in front of their King), forget about trading pieces. The goal becomes Checkmate.

    The Concept: Point your pieces at the enemy King’s house.

    The Strategy: "The Battery." This is when you line up two pieces (like a Queen and Bishop, or Queen and Rook) on the same line to create a super-attack.
    The Metaphor: "The Battering Ram." One piece knocks on the door, the piece behind it smashes it down.

    The Lab: Line up a Bishop on c4 and a Queen on f3. Show how they both stare at the f7 square (the weak spot near the King). This creates a deadly threat.

🔄 Goal #3: The "Smart Swap" (When to Trade)

This answers your question directly. She should only trade pieces ("Swap Lunch") in three specific situations. Teach her the "Traffic Light of Trading":

    🟢 GREEN LIGHT (Trade!):

        You have more material. (If you have an extra Rook, trade everything else off! It’s easier to win with Rook vs Nothing than Rook + 5 pieces vs 5 pieces).

    🟡 YELLOW LIGHT (Think first):

        It fixes your pieces. (e.g., Your Knight is stuck in a corner and can't move. You trade it for their active Bishop. Good trade!).

    🔴 RED LIGHT (Stop!):

        You are losing. (If you have fewer pieces, do NOT trade. You need to keep pieces on the board to create "tricks" or "complications").

        The "lazy" trade. (Don't trade just because you don't know what else to move).

🧩 How to practice this (The "What's the Plan?" Game)

To teach this, you don't need to play a full game. Play "Freeze Frame."

    Play a game with her until move 10 or 15.

    STOP the game. Don't make a move.

    Ask her: "Okay, look at the board. Which plan should we choose?"

        Option A: Is there a loose piece we can Gang Up on?

        Option B: Is their King open? Should we build a Battery?

        Option C: Are we winning? Should we Trade everything down?

Summary for her:

    "We don't just trade to trade. We trade to get rid of their good pieces or when we are already winning. Otherwise, we Gang Up on their weak guys!"
