Mission "Hunt the Weakling"

The Problem: Not knowing what to attack.

    The Core Rule: "Attack the lonely pieces."

    The Concept: Look for enemy pieces or pawns that have no friends holding their hands (undefended pieces). We call these "Loose Pieces." Loose pieces drop off (get captured)!

    The Lab (Exercise):

        Spot the Loner: Pause a real game (or use a position from a book). Ask her to point to every enemy piece that is not protected by another piece. Those are her targets.

    Progress Check: If a pawn is standing all alone, is it safe or dangerous?
