Week 2: Mission "Wake Up the Army"

    The Core Rule: "Knights and Bishops must wake up before the Queen!"

    The Concept (Development): Your pieces are sleeping in the back row. You need to wake them up. Knights like to jump into the battle first, then Bishops. The Queen likes to sleep in—don't wake her up too early, or the enemy will chase her!

    The Lab (Exercise):

        The Race to 4: Play a game. The first person to get both Knights and both Bishops off the back row wins the "Speed Badge" (even if they lose the game later!).

    Progress Check: Who should come out to play first: The powerful Queen or the jumping Knights?
