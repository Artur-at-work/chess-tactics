Mission "The Trade Off"

The Problem: Being afraid to capture pieces.

    The Core Rule: "When you are winning, trade! When you are losing, complicate."

    The Concept: Imagine you have 5 pieces and the enemy has 3. If you trade one for one, you will have 4 and they will have 2. The more you swap, the easier it is for your big army to beat their tiny army.

    The Lab (Exercise):

        Simplification: Give her a Queen and two Rooks. Give yourself just a Queen. Tell her the goal is not to checkmate yet, but to force a trade of Queens. Once the Queens are gone, she wins easily.

    Progress Check: You have an extra Rook. The enemy offers to trade Queens. Do you say "Yes" or "No"? (Answer: YES! It makes the game easier to win).
