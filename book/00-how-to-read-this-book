Tactics for young kids in digestable format without much theory. Assuming that kid already knows how to move the pieces, but don't know where or with what purpose. 
This collection of tutorials is to teach a mental model on "Why I want to move my piece there?", "What's my short and long term goal in this game?"
Study one chapter per session and do the small practice to make it easier to remember. Goal is to keep it interesting for kids and easy to apply in their games, so they are willing to come back and learn more.

Generated with Gemini and verified on my 7 years old daughter.

Questions to build the mental model closer to middle game:
    "Am I safe?" (Is my King okay? Did I leave anything unguarded?)

    "What is my opponent doing?" (Why did they move there? What do they want to eat?)

    "How can I improve my worst piece?" (Look at your pieces. Is there a Knight stuck in the corner? A Bishop blocked by a pawn? Move the worst piece to a better square.)
