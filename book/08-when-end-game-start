How do we know the Endgame started?

There is no alarm bell, but there is one giant clue. Tell her to watch for:

"The Queens have left the building."

    The Visual Cue: Usually, when the Queens are traded off (captured) and maybe a set of Rooks are gone, the board looks "empty."

    The Safety Check: Ask: "Is there anyone left on the board who can checkmate my King in one move?" If the answer is No (because the Queens and most pieces are gone), the Endgame has started.

⚙️ The "Big Switch": How to Prepare

When the Endgame starts, she has to flip a switch in her brain. The rules of the game actually change!
In the Opening and Middlegame, you hunt the King. In the Endgame, you hunt a New Queen.

1. The King Switch: From "Coward" to "Action Hero"

    Middlegame Rule: "Hide the King! Keep him in the castle corner!"

    Endgame Rule: "Run to the center! The King is now a fighting piece!"

    Why? With the Queens gone, the King is safe. He must run to the middle of the board to help his pawns. A King in the center is powerful; a King in the corner loses the game.

    The Mantra: "Queens off? King up!"

2. The Pawn Switch: From "Shield" to "Baby Queen"

    Middlegame Rule: "Pawns are shields to protect the King."

    Endgame Rule: "Pawns are Baby Queens. Run them to the end!"

    The Goal: The only goal in the endgame is to get a pawn to the other side (Promotion). Every pawn decision should be: "Does this help a pawn become a Queen?"

🛠️ Preparation: The "Trading Trick" (The Golden Rule)

How do you "prepare" for the endgame while you are still playing the middlegame? You prepare by choosing which pieces to swap.

Teach her this rhyme/rule:

    "If you are winning, swap the Pieces." "If you are losing, swap the Pawns."

    Why swap pieces if winning? If you have 5 pawns and they have 4, it is hard to win with all the Bishops and Rooks flying around. But if you trade all the Bishops and Rooks, you have a "King + 5 Pawns" vs "King + 4 Pawns." That is an easy win!

    Why swap pawns if losing? If you are losing, you want to eliminate their pawns. If you trade off all the pawns, they can't make a Queen, and the game ends in a Draw (even if they have an extra Bishop!).

🧪 The Lab: "King of the Mountain"

To practice the "King Activation," play this mini-game.

    Setup: Clear the board. Put her King on e1 and your King on e8. Put 3 pawns on h2/g2/f2 and 3 pawns on h7/g7/f7.

    The Game: No pieces, just Kings and Pawns.

    The Goal: First person to get their King to the center of the board (e4, d4, e5, d5) gets a point. Then, play until someone promotes a pawn.

    The Lesson: She will see quickly that if she leaves her King in the back, your King will march up and eat all her pawns.

📝 Summary Checklist for Her

When the Queens get traded, ask these three questions:

    "Is my King safe?" (Yes, the Queens are gone).

    "Then where does the King go?" (To the Center!).

    "What is my mission?" (Push a pawn to make a new Queen).
