In the Opening and Middlegame, you hunt the King. In the Endgame, you hunt a New Queen.

Here is the simple logic to teach her:
1. The "Firepower" Problem

In chess, you need heavy weapons to trap a King.

    King + Bishop vs King? Draw. (Impossible to checkmate).

    King + Knight vs King? Draw. (Impossible to checkmate).

    King + King? Draw.

If she loses all her big pieces and only has her King and a Knight left, she cannot win even if she plays perfectly. She just doesn't have enough power to corner the enemy.
2. The Solution: The "Magic Potion"

Pawns are the only pieces that can transform.

    A Pawn is weak (a "baby").

    But a Pawn that reaches the other side becomes a Queen (a "superhero").

So, the roadmap changes completely:

    Old Goal: Checkmate the King.

    New Goal: Protect the Baby. Get the pawn to the end of the board.

Once the pawn becomes a Queen, THEN you go back to "Checkmate Mode" (using the techniques from Week 11 & 12, like the Box Method or Ladder Mate).
🧩 The "Why Pawns Are Better Than Knights" Lesson

This is a mind-blowing moment for a 7-year-old.

The Concept: In the endgame, a tiny Pawn is often worth more than a Knight or Bishop.

The Logic:

    If I have a King + Knight, the game is a tie. I go home sad.

    If I have a King + Pawn, I can make a Queen. I win!

The Lab (Exercise): "The Magic Trick"

    Setup A: Put White King and White Bishop vs. Black King. Let her try to checkmate you. (She will chase you around forever, but she can never trap you). Tell her: "See? Not enough power."

    Setup B: Put White King and White Pawn vs. Black King.

        Help her walk the King and Pawn up the board together.

        Turn the Pawn into a Queen.

        Now ask her to checkmate you. (She will do it easily).

📝 The Endgame Flowchart for Her

Print this mental map for her:

    Are the Queens gone? → Yes.

    Can I checkmate right now? → No (Not enough pieces).

    NEW MISSION: Find a "Passed Pawn" (a pawn with no one in front of it).

    Escort Mission: Use your King to hold the pawn's hand and walk it to the other side.

    Promotion: Make a new Queen.

    Checkmate: Use the new Queen to finish the game.

💡 A Fun Metaphor: "The Escort Mission"

Tell her the Pawn is a "VIP" (Very Important Person) or a "Pop Star" trying to get to a concert at the end of the board. The King is the Bodyguard. The Bodyguard (King) must go in front of the Pop Star (Pawn) to clear the way!

    Wrong way: Pushing the pawn while the King stays behind (The Pop Star gets mugged!).

    Right way: King marches in front, clears the path, and the pawn follows safely.
