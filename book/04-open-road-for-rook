Mission "The Open Road"

The Problem: The pieces are out, but they are just staring at each other.

    The Core Rule: "Rooks love open roads."

    The Concept: Rooks hate traffic jams. If there is a column (file) with no pawns or only one pawn, that is an "Open Road." Move your Rooks there! It allows them to drive deep into the enemy base.

    The Lab (Exercise):

        Traffic Control: Set up a board with random pawns. Have her identify which files (columns) are "Open" (no pawns), "Half-Open" (only enemy pawns), or "Closed" (blocked by pawns).

    Progress Check: Where does the Rook want to go? (Answer: To the column with no traffic!).
